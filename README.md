---Demise---

The plan:
	Make a 3d game in the style of wolfenstein.

	A dungeon crawling shooter.

	Rendered using a binary space partition (bsp).

	The game will use SFML to draw the 2d graphics, but I will be doing the 3d rendering and projections.


This is the prototype stage of the project.
I'm testing new ideas and learning the techniques that I'm going to use.
