---Demise---

This is a 3d first-person maze crawling experience.

It is a 3d game rendered in the style of wolfenstein/doom 
using a binary space partition (bsp).

The game uses SFML to draw the 2d graphics, but 3d projection and perspective is done internally.

[Here is a short video explaining the project.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4UJuVc9Mvo&feature=youtu.be).
