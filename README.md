The plan:
	Make a 3d game in the style of wolfenstein.

	Rendered using a binary space partition (bsp).

	The game will use SFML to draw the 2d graphics, but 3d projection and perspective is done internally.


This is the prototype stage of the project.
We're testing new ideas and learning techniques that need to be used.
