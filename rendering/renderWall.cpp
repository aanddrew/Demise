for the x coordinate on the screen, we can't just mutiply by a constant.
This is easy to see because if an object is any distance away from
	the viewer,
This results in the coordinate never ending up in the center...
FACEPALM
I have a solution to this problem

We give the camera (Player) a normal vector
The dot product of the toStart, toEnd vectors with that vector tells us this
		   wall.start()
	^	  /
x |	 /
	v	/__> 			p.getVec().
p   |
	  v
  p.getNormal();

 The distance x is the value we care about.
 x is toStart.dot(p.getNormal());

  The dod product of the normal with the wall.start tells us how far away in the 
  "effective x" direction (i.e. the distance perpendicularly from the player's 
  view vector)

			 temp makes a right angle with the line that z makes right here.
			 VERY IMPORTANT

		  Here is what the scene looks like currently
		  The player is facing forward and there is a wall whose starting point
		  	is behind the player
		  	and whose end point is in front of the player
		  The plan:
		  	Scale the face vector so that we only get the portion that is in
		  		front of the player
				Then we can just draw it like normal
			How to accomplish:
				SIMILAR TRIANGLES!!!! That's right I knew this stuff was useful
				lets set up some triangles here

				We want to figure out what the ratio of scale to the full 
					hypotenuse of the triangle is
				well, since these triangles are similar...
					scale = 1 - little_hypotenuse/big_hypotenuse
					little_hypotenuse/big_hypotenuse
				 =
				 	littleX/similarX

				 great.
				 Now we need to find littleX and similarX
				 similarX is easy.
				 	it's the component of face that is going in the same direction as
				 		p.getNormal() => face.dot(p.getNormal())
				 littleX, this requires some advanced similar triangles
				 	lets set something up
				 	 littleX    	     z
				 	 -------    =   -------
				 	   z 						  bigX
				 	 therefore,
				 	 littleX = z*z/bigX
				 	This is where that line comes from down there

				 Then we just calculate the scale,
				 scale the vector, and then we recalibrate our xDiff and z variables

			If you actually want to understand this, you need to get out pen and paper
			and probably build it yourself.
			It took me many days to figure this out but it works like a charm.
